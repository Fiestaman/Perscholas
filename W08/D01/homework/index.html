    <h3>1. How do you make a Circle in CSS?</h3>
    <h4>
      There are a few ways to make a circle in CSS.
      <ol>
        <li>
          Border-radius property: takes four values, one for each corner of the
          element. The values can be either numbers or percentages. If you want
          to make a perfect circle, set the values to 50% for all four corners.
        </li>
        <li>Shape-outside property: takes a value of circle().</li>
        <li>
          Clip-path property: takes a value to define the shape of the circle.
        </li>
        <li>
          SVG element: The &ltcircle&gt element takes a number of attributes,
          including cx, cy, r, and fill. The cx and cy attributes define the
          center of the circle, the r attribute defines the radius of the
          circle, and the fill attribute defines the fill color of the circle.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </h4>
    <!-- Here is an example of how to make a circle using the border-radius property:
      
      .circle {
        border-radius: 50%;
        width: 100px;
        height: 100px;
        background-color: blue;
      }
      Here is an example of how to make a circle using the shape-outside property:
      
      .circle {
        width: 100px;
        height: 100px;
        background-color: blue;
      }
      
      .circle:after {
        content: "";
        position: absolute;
        top: 0;
        right: 0;
        bottom: 0;
        left: 0;
        border-radius: 50%;
        clip-path: circle(50%);
      }
      Here is an example of how to make a circle using the svg element:
      
      <svg width="100" height="100" viewBox="0 0 100 100">
        <circle cx="50" cy="50" r="40" fill="blue" />
      </svg></h4> -->
    <h3>2. What is Z-index?</h3>
    <h4>
      Z-index is a CSS property that specifies the stacking order of elements
      that overlap. An element with a greater z-index will always be in front of
      an element with a lower z-index.
    </h4>
    <h3>3. What is a Vendor Prefix and What is it's Purpose?</h3>
    <h4>
      A vendor prefix is a string that is added to the name of a CSS property or
      JavaScript function to indicate that it is a proprietary feature of a
      particular browser vendor. For example, the -webkit- prefix is used by
      Webkit browsers (such as Chrome and Safari), the -moz- prefix is used by
      Mozilla browsers (such as Firefox), and the -ms- prefix is used by
      Microsoft browsers (such as Internet Explorer).
      <br />
      Vendor prefixes are used because browsers often implement new features
      before they are standardized. By adding a vendor prefix to a feature,
      browser vendors can test the feature in their browsers and get feedback
      from users without worrying about breaking compatibility with other
      browsers.

    <h3>4. What is the difference between CSS Grid and Flexbox?</h3>
    <h4>
      CSS Grid is a two-dimensional layout system, which means that you can use
      it to create layouts that have both rows and columns. It is also very
      flexible, and you can use it to create complex layouts that would be
      difficult or impossible to create with Flexbox.
      <br />
      Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout system, which means that you can only
      use it to create layouts that have rows or columns, but not both. It is
      also not as flexible as CSS Grid, but it is easier to learn and use.

    <h4>
      You can use Lighthouse to audit your website for performance,
      accessibility, progressive web apps, SEO, and more.

    <h3>6. What is CRUD?</h3>
    <h4>
      CRUD is an acronym for Create, Read, Update, and Delete. It is a term used
      in computer programming to describe the four basic operations that can be
      performed on data.
    </h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Create: This operation creates a new record of data.</li>
      <li>
        Read: This operation retrieves a record of data from the database.
      </li>
      <li>Update: This operation modifies an existing record of data.</li>
      <li>
        Delete: This operation removes a record of data from the database.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>7. What is OOP?</h3>
    <h4>
      OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming. It is a programming paradigm
      that is based on the concept of objects. Objects are entities that have
      state and behavior. The state of an object is represented by its data, and
      the behavior of an object is represented by its methods.
      <p>
        OOP is a powerful programming paradigm that has many advantages over
        other programming paradigms. Some of the advantages of OOP include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the process of hiding the internal
          details of an object from the outside world. This makes it difficult
          for other objects to accidentally modify the state of an object.
        </li>
        <li>
          Inheritance: Inheritance is the process of creating a new object that
          inherits the properties and methods of an existing object. This can
          save a lot of time and effort, as you do not have to write the code
          for the properties and methods of the new object from scratch.
        </li>
        <li>
          Polymorphism: Polymorphism is the ability of an object to respond to
          different messages in different ways. This allows you to create
          objects that can be used in a variety of different ways.
        </li>
      </ul>
