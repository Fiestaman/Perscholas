      The three development concepts that enable the creation of comprehensive
      single-page applications are:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>AJAX:</strong> AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML.
        It is a set of web development techniques that allow web pages to
        communicate with a web server asynchronously. This means that the page
        can continue to load and update without the user having to refresh the
        page.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>JavaScript frameworks:</strong> JavaScript frameworks are
        libraries of code that provide a set of pre-built components and
        functionality that can be used to build web applications. Some popular
        JavaScript frameworks include React, Angular, and Vue.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>APIs:</strong> APIs, or Application Programming Interfaces, are
        sets of rules that allow two pieces of software to communicate with each
        other. APIs can be used to access data from other websites or
        applications, or to control other devices or systems. By using these
        three concepts, developers can create single-page applications that are
        rich in functionality and can provide a seamless user experience.
